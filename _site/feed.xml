Enough intro, lets talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-context-the-big-picture&quot;&gt;The context; the big picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a 100% pure and calm lake. Now a small contaminated water drop drops into this lake and causes ripples in the lake. The lake became disturbed for a while, but now has some impurity in it. The essence is not the same before. Suddenly, someone feeds this lake more and more such drops, thereby causing a regular disturbance ripple and increased amount of contamination. Now in this, replace the lake with your relationship and the dirty water drop with misunderstandings or heated fights with personal attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, we have seen the increased number of nuclear families, short marriages, broken blood relationships and lack of good friendships. More often than not, especially in case of loved ones, it is miscommunication and improper handling of disagreements that leads to this unfortunate consequence. A small misunderstanding causes a heated debate which eventually leads to bitterness in the relationship, in most cases. You know what is the worst? When the personal attacks start popping out of angered emotions.This is the lowest point. Once you start attacking each other personally, I would say all objectivity is lost, and you are ultimately nowhere forward. Sounds familiar? Happens to almost all of us I believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-usually-happens-the-smaller-picture&quot;&gt;What usually happens; the smaller picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you and your close one are faced with a disagreement ,a conflict, or a circumstance created problem, the EGO enters the arena. Sad but true. You have one thing in mind and the other has the polar opposite of it. What happens next? You both start argueing on why you are right, ultimately losing the real perspective and the problem behind. It becomes a UN level debate wtih him/her even though both of you want (world) peace. Pun intended. You feel you are right.Interjection to your opinion sparks heated conversation. And trust me, the conversation isn’t lit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;faded&quot;&gt;(I know you must be thinking, does this guy have a point or just has a bunch of bad puns put together? I guess I really can’t help myself at times.**Chuckles on the puns**)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very common thing that I have noticed is that interrelationship problems originate from small and often, stupid misunderstandings. Small instances that occur or misinterpretation of what one said to the other is something all of us can relate to. Infact, a bad mood completely alters our viewpoint, makes us feel cynical about everything. Suddenly everyone around us is just straight up bad. These misunderstandings are the cause for negative bias towards the other if not handled delicately. Our mood affects how we interpret and react to something. End result? You are angry at your loved one, probably without good cause. Your consequent actions and words impacted by the latter most probably leads to a fight. Now both of you are in angered and rather confused emotional state. For most of us, the ego dominates. The arguement brews. You are now versus each other. Now take a breather. Wouldn’t it be better if it was both of you vs the problem? Facing the problem together? #Foodforthought&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-how-do-we-properly-handle-this&quot;&gt;So how do we properly handle this?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be saying that easier said than done. How do we actually practice this?&lt;br /&gt;
We are built in a way that it is almost natural for us to engage all defenses when we as an individual are told we aren’t right. Its the rejection reaction if I may say so. It is a very mature and probably difficult thing to do to actually acknowledge the opposite perspective and addressing it as viable or maybe correct a step further. Long story short, the meaning of “Us vs the Problem” rather than “You vs Me” is to realise that you are not facing this issue as an individual,  together. As one. In times of adversity,we forget such simple things hence this becomes easier said than done. You remove your individuality since this is not only yours to handle, use the trust that you and your loved one have built. Focus on the problem rather than proving yourself right and winning the arguement. Infact, it shouldn’t even be an arguement. Yes, clashes or differences of opinion don’t have to be arguements or debates. Normalise conflict resolution through DISCUSSION rather than debating the motion as to who is right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;end-notes&quot;&gt;End notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the beauty of this discussion approach if I may call it so, is that its all in your control. Life rarely gives that, if I am being really honest. Your perspective, your attitude, your way of talking, its all YOU.To build this perspective takes time and patience. It also requires the cooperation of your partner or loved one. Speaking in a more practical manner, for every kind of problem in relationships, you can do this. Your approach towards the conflict needs to be in a way you are addressing the problem, not fighting your solution on how to deal with it. You have to throw the dominating ego aside, DISCUSS the issue even though it may affect you more directly. Discussing instead of complaining or debating is the way I like to see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One question that you may have is that what if the other person doesn’t react similiarly? Well feel free to express this to them as a seperate discussion if you share such an understanding on things. After all, trying is life, isn’t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;faded&quot;&gt;(Or is life trying? I say depends on your day. #AnotherFoodforthought)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most joyous consequence of this is that your relationship comes out stronger than before. You overcome issues by teamwork, which strengthens the bond. So basically what you just did is you played an UNO Reverse card on the adverse situation. In trying times that test your relationship, you come out even better. I would even say that, winning an arguement is almost kiddish. And from personal experience, the satisfaction and joy of striding forward together makes you feel elated at a completely other level.  After all, I think, what is love, if not teamwork persevering?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Aneesh Dua</name><email>workstuff.dua@gmail.com</email></author><category term="lblog" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/usvsproblem/1.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/usvsproblem/1.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Hardening VS Countermeasures for Cyber Security</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/tblog/2019-06-23-hardening-counter/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hardening VS Countermeasures for Cyber Security" /><published>2019-06-23T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-06-23T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/tblog/hardening-counter</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/tblog/2019-06-23-hardening-counter/">&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;Cyber Attacks are exponentially increasing by the day. The omnipresence of Internet enabled devices around us makes such attacks terrorizing for us. Thus, to resist such threats, it is essential to develop mechanisms and protect our devices and networks. There are mainly two ways to go about it, either we build countermeasures against attacks or either we implement hardening of devices and connection methods. How should we go about it?
Lets discuss…….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hardening&quot;&gt;Hardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardening one of the most important components of system security. It is a method of securing devices/networks by minimizing the area exposed to the public. This makes sure that there are less vulnerabilities out in the open. This is done largely by removing unnecessary software, hardening default credentials, disabling unnecessary services, and modifying other configuration parameters from default values so that the system works securely for a focused set of services.
For networks and systems of the organisational and corporate level, the risk of security breach is high. Their systems are diverse and widely spread, hence, a hacker only needs to find one weak point in the plethora of connected devices to get into the network and he is really spoilt for choice! On the contrary, smaller networks such as home networks are relatively more secure as they have less areas of susceptibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter whichever new system is setup, the hardening process is critical to establish a baseline of system security, especially for an organization. Moreover, when a new system is bought, it comes pre-installed with a number of software, applications, services, drivers, features, and even bloatware. All these are points at which the security fence is weak and can be easily broken by hacker(s). It is, therefore, necessary to remove the unnecessary software and configure the necessary ones for additional security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actions that are normally taken when performing system hardening are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disabling certain ports and stopping certain services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removing certain features of the operating system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uninstalling unnecessary and vulnerable software&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changing default settings and removing features and applications not needed by your organization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensuring each system’s security configurations are set properly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensuring OS software, firmware, and applications are up to date&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensuring the system hardening process evolves constantly, with maximum automation and updating&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Testing during hardening of the systems to make sure anything critical to the organization is not impacted&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updating the hardening to include new patches or software versions in the standard configuration, so the addition of a similar system in future does not come with the old weaknesses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;countermeasures&quot;&gt;Countermeasures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developers of operating system and software do not think much about the security aspect. This is understandable because they are developers and not cyber security specialists. Hackers often exploit the developers’ code itself and compromise the integrity, availability and confidentiality of the systems. Hence, it is essential to have countermeasures so as to make software and operating systems secure.
In cyber security, methods that provide security against vulnerability threats and cyber attack(s) are known as cyber crime countermeasures. Antiviruses and Firewalls are the most common methods of providing cyber attack countermeasures. The companies that provide these, scan the internet for new malware and also perform vulnerability testing on the systems they are made to protect. This is done on a regular basis as they have to keep updating the operating systems for patching the bugs and release anti-malware methods.&lt;br /&gt;
There are mainly four basic types of countermeasures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preventative — These work by keeping something from happening in the first place. Examples of this include: security awareness training, firewall, anti-virus, security guard and IPS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reactive — Reactive countermeasures come into effect only after an event has already occurred.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Detective — Examples of detective counter measures include: system monitoring, IDS, anti-virus, motion detectors and IPS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Administrative — These controls are the process of developing and ensuring compliance with policy and procedures. These use policy methods to protect an asset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So….whats the conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I would think of it as an analogy to the Marvel Comics. Hardening is Captain America and Countermeasures are like Iron Man. Lemme explain.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/hdncntr/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Full-width image&quot; class=&quot;lead&quot; width=&quot;80&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Captain America was made into a more powerful soldier, hence, if I may, his abilities were hardened. His physique completely changed while his core remained the same, just like hardening of protocols and software architecture.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tony Stark made a super suit to defend the world from outer space threats. He did not make any changes to himself for this, the suit was an outer protective cover as a countermeasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these heroes in cyber security are essential and one can’t really compare. However, it maybe better to have hardened protocols rather countermeasures. Still countermeasures are always going to be exist because when it comes to cyber security, one can’t be 100% sure. It is important to note that the implementation of both affects the quality of their purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Aneesh Dua</name><email>workstuff.dua@gmail.com</email></author><category term="tblog" /><summary type="html">Cyber Attacks are exponentially increasing by the day.

Even today we encounter websites that are “down” a.k.a unavailable and the reason for that more often than not are DDoS attacks. Even though the principle of these have remained the same, we still don’t have a fool proof way of preventing them. Not beating about the bush, let me throw light as to what they actually are and why they are still a cyber security challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-it-is&quot;&gt;What it is?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A denial-of-service(DOS) attack is where hackers render a site inaccessible to legitimate customers. Hackers do this by overwhelming the website with traffic and data until the website crashes. Although denial-of-service attacks do not have a direct financial cost to the victims, the indirect cost of lost sales can be high not to mention the frustration of getting the website up and running again.
E-commerce websites are the most likely targets of denial-of-service attacks. That said, hackers have been known to go after different types of high-profile businesses including media agencies and government organizations.
Besides keeping your anti-virus software and security patches up-to-date, you should also be monitoring your traffic reports to protect against a denial-of-service attack. A sudden increase in traffic or other strange traffic patterns could be an early sign of this type of attack.
A distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is a special type of denial of service attack. The principle is the same, but the malicious traffic is generated from multiple sources — although orchestrated from one central point. The fact that the traffic sources are distributed — often throughout the world — makes a DDoS attack much harder to block than one originating from a single IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/ddos/2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Full-width image&quot; class=&quot;lead&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;motivation-behind-ddos-attacks&quot;&gt;Motivation behind DDoS attacks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trend of DDoS attacks is towards shorter attack duration, but bigger packet-per-second attack volume.
Attackers are primarily motivated by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rebellion— DDoS attacks as a means of targeting websites hackers disagree with ideologically.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business rivalry— Businesses can use DDoS attacks on their rivals to gain the customers of the other.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fun—Script-kiddies use pre-written scripts or softwre to launch DDoS attacks. The perpetrators of these attacks are typically bored.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cyber warfare — Countries these days have engaged in Cyber Warfare. Most of us are unaware of such events as they happen quietly on the Dark Web. Government authorized DDoS attacks are an example of the latter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;taxonomy&quot;&gt;Taxonomy:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Volume Based Attacks&lt;br /&gt;
Includes UDP floods, ICMP floods, and other spoofed-packet floods. The attack’s goal is to saturate the bandwidth of the attacked site, and magnitude is measured in bits per second (Bps).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Protocol Attacks&lt;br /&gt;
Includes SYN floods, fragmented packet attacks, Ping of Death, Smurf DDoS and more. This type of attack consumes actual server resources, or those of intermediate communication equipment, such as firewalls and load balancers, and is measured in packets per second (Pps).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application Layer Attacks&lt;br /&gt;
Includes low-and-slow attacks, GET/POST floods, attacks that target Apache, Windows or OpenBSD vulnerabilities and more. Comprised of seemingly legitimate and innocent requests, the goal of these attacks is to crash the web server, and the magnitude is measured in Requests per second (Rps).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-do-we-stand&quot;&gt;Where do we stand?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DDoS attacks are becoming increasingly commonplace, according to research published by Corero Network Security at the end of 2017. Its DDoS Trends and Analysis report found that the number of attacks increased by 35% between Q2 2017 and Q3 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason for their increased prevalence is the increasing number of insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices that are being infected and recruited into botnets such as Reaper.
The volume of data launched at DDoS attack victims has also gone up significantly, largely thanks to amplification attacks such as the memcached amplification attack technique. Earlier this year, cyber-criminals launched some 15,000 memcached attacks, including an attack on GitHub that maxed out at an astonishing 1.35 Tbps(Tera Bits per second).
There is no cure that fits all. There is no single fool proof method that can prevent or even stop a ddos attack due to the variety of the latter. So what do we do for such a disease?
We Vaccinate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-build-resistance&quot;&gt;How to Build Resistance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Buy more bandwidth(than you might ever need)
Of all the ways to prevent DDoS attacks, the most basic step you can take to make your infrastructure “DDoS resistant” is to ensure that you have enough bandwidth to handle spikes in traffic that may be caused by malicious activity.
In the past it was possible to avoid DDoS attacks by ensuring that you had more bandwidth at your disposal than any attacker was likely to have. But with the rise of amplification attacks, this is no longer practical. Instead, buying more bandwidth now raises the bar which attackers have to overcome before they can launch a successful DDoS attack, but by itself, purchasing more bandwidth is not a DDoS attack solution.
Even if you bought extra 100 percent — or 500 percent — that likely won’t stop a DDoS attack. But it may give you a few extra minutes to act before your resources are overwhelmed completely. So we go from seconds to disaster to minutes to stopping the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build redundancy into your infrastructure
To make it as hard as possible for an attacker to successfully launch a DDoS attack against your servers, make sure you spread them across multiple data centers with a good load balancing system to distribute traffic between them. If possible, these data centers should be in different countries, or at least in different regions of the same country.
For this strategy to be truly effective, it’s necessary to ensure that the data centers are connected to different networks and that there are no obvious network bottlenecks or single points of failure on these networks.
Distributing your severs geographically and topographically will make it hard for an attacker to successfully attack more than a portion of your servers, leaving other servers unaffected and capable of taking on at least some of the extra traffic that the affected servers would normally handle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Configure your network hardware against DDoS attacks
There are a number of simple hardware configuration changes you can take to help prevent a DDoS attack.
For example, configuring your firewall or router to drop incoming ICMP packets or block DNS responses from outside your network (by blocking UDP port 53) can help prevent certain DNS and ping-based volumetric attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deploy Anti-DDoS software modules
Your servers should be protected by network firewalls and more specialized web application firewalls, and you should probably use load balancers as well.Amazon Web Services provide load balancers to websites hosted on their server(EC2)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protect your DNS servers
Don’t forget that a malicious actor may be able to bring your web servers offline by DDoSing your DNS servers. For that reason it is important that your DNS servers have redundancy, and placing them in different data centers behind load balancers is also a good idea. A better solution may even be to move to a cloud-based DNS provider that can offer high bandwidth and multiple points-of-presence in data centers around the world. These services are specifically designed with DDoS prevention in mind.
However……
Preventing a DDoS attack when malicious actors can launch over 1 Tbps at your servers is almost impossible, and that means that it is more than important than ever to understand how to stop a DDoS attack after it has started to affect your operations. Here are some tips for when you are under such an attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identify the DDoS attack early
The detection phase requires analysis of the running system to discover malicious traffic that leads to a DDoS attack. Detection involves a sophisticated approach to identify large unexpected traffic against a web server. Most of the detection techniques were applied to form DDoS detection known as pattern matching, clustering, statistical methods, deviation analysis, associations, and correlation. Formation of detection usually employs data history as the main source to train the data to generate a threshold which will be assigned to a parameter via a specific method to count the GET request received.
If you run your own servers, then you need to be able to identify when you are under attack. That’s because the sooner you can establish that problems with your website are due to a DDoS attack, the sooner you can stop the DDoS attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Call your ISP or hosting provider
The next step is to call your ISP (or hosting provider if you do not host your own Web server), tell them you are under attack, and ask for help. Keep emergency contacts for your ISP or hosting provider readily available so you can do this quickly. Depending on the strength of the attack, the ISP or hoster may already have detected it — or they may themselves start to be overwhelmed by the attack.
You stand a better chance of withstanding a DDoS attack if your Web server is located in a hosting center than if you run it yourself. That’s because its data center will likely have far higher bandwidth links and higher capacity routers than your company has, and its staff will probably have more experience dealing with attacks. Having your Web server located with a hoster will also keep DDoS traffic aimed at your Web server off your corporate LAN so at least that part of your business — including email and possibly voice over IP (VoIP) services — should operate normally during an attack.
“It can be very costly for a hosting company to allow a DDoS onto their network because it consumes a lot of bandwidth and can affect other customers, so the first thing we might do is black hole you for a while,” said Liam Enticknap, a network operations engineer at PEER 1 hosting.
Tim Pat Dufficy, managing director of ISP and hosting company ServerSpace, agreed. “The first thing we do when we see a customer under attack is log onto our routers and stop the traffic getting onto our network,” he says. “That takes about two minutes to propagate globally using BGP (border gateway protocol) and then traffic falls off.”
If that was the end of the story, the DDoS attack would still be successful. To get the website back online, your ISP or hosting company may divert traffic to a “scrubber,” where the malicious packets can be removed before the legitimate ones are be sent on to your Web server.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a DDoS playbook
The best way to ensure that your organization reacts as quickly and effectively as possible to stop a DDoS attack is to create a playbook that documents in detail every step of a pre-planned response when an attack is detected.
This should include the actions detailed above, with contact names and telephone numbers of all those who may need to be brought into action as part of the playbook’s plan. DDoS mitigation companies can help with this by running a simulated DDoS attack, enabling you to develop and refine a rapid corporate procedure for reacting to a real attack.
An important part of your planned response to a DDoS attack that should not be overlooked is how you communicate the problem to customers. DDoS attacks can last as long as 24 hours, and good communication can ensure that the cost to your business is minimized while you remain under attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As of now there isn’t any silver bullet for DDoS attacks, the quest goes on!!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

I would rather call it E-conning so as to simply state what it really is.If something sounds too good to be true… there’s probably a scammer behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-it-is&quot;&gt;So what it is?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phishing in general means to copy a website or email and act as an authenticated person in order to trick the victim into revealing sensitive information. Such attacks can lead to damaging losses in terms of identity theft,sensitive intellectual property and customer information, and national-security secrets.
Phishers always take advantage of human nature that generally ignores critical warning messages. Lack of awareness about the phishing attacks in the society is also the main reason why phishing attacks have been so much successful. Whenever any researcher came with some technique to prevent these attacks, phishers try to ﬁnd out associated loophole to commit successful attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-damage-can-they-do&quot;&gt;What damage can they do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/phishing/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Full-width image&quot; class=&quot;lead&quot; width=&quot;80&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Theft of login credentials: Phisher steals login credentials of online services like eBay, Amazon and Gmail from the user using spoofed email as warning message to change password and provided hyperlink.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Theft of banking credentials: Online login credentials and credit card details such as card number, expiry and issue dates, cardholder’s name, CCV number and several other popular banking organizations like PayPal, OnlineSBI, HDFC and Citibank.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capture of personal information: Personal information, such as address and telephone number, is highly saleable and in constant demand by direct marketing companies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Theft of trade secrets and conﬁdential documents: With spear phishing techniques, phishers are targeting speciﬁc organizations for acquisition of proprietary information and used directly or sold to interested parties.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fame and notoriety: A very interesting psychological aspect of phishing in which information is phished not for ﬁnancial gain but carried out mainly to gain recognition and notoriety among their peers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exploit security holes: People who are curious to ﬁnd out how robust a particular system is may try to write programs to break somebody else’s system to launch phishing attacks or to sell the compromised systems to other phishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-a-bad-guy-actually-do-it&quot;&gt;How does a bad guy actually do it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stage-1-planning-and-setup&quot;&gt;Stage 1: Planning and setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ﬁrst step, the attackers identify the target organization or individual or a nation. Then, their task is to get details about the organization and its network. It can be done by visiting the place physically or monitor the trafﬁc going in and out of the network. The next step is to set up the attacks by using a feasible means, e.g., website or emails having malicious links, which may redirect the victim to some fraud web page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stage-2-phishingit-is-as-similar-to-fishing-as-it-sounds&quot;&gt;Stage 2: Phishing(it is as similar to fishing as it sounds)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to send these spoofed emails or links, e.g., masqueraded as some reputed banking organization to the victim using the collected email addresses, which ask user to update some information urgently by clicking on some malicious link. The emails might be sent to individuals or speciﬁc person in an organization. Basically, they send out such malicious links and wait for the fish to get caught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stage-3-break-ininﬁltration&quot;&gt;Stage 3: Break-in/inﬁltration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as the victim(fish) opens the fraud link, either a malware is installed on the system which allows the attacker to intrude the system and change its conﬁguration or access rights are changed accordingly. In other cases, it might lead to some fake page that asks for credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stage-4data-collection&quot;&gt;Stage 4:Data collection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the attackers get access to the user’s system, the required data are extracted, and if the user gives his account details to the attacker, they can now access his/her account, and this may lead to ﬁnancial losses to the victim. In case of malware attacks, now the attacker may get remote access to the system and get the data he/she wants whatsoever, or the compromised systems could be used for DDoS attacks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stage-5-break-outexﬁltration&quot;&gt;Stage 5: Break-out/exﬁltration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting the required information, the phisher now removes all the evidences, i.e., the false websites accounts. It is also observed that they track the degree of success of their attack for reﬁning future attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-stay-safe&quot;&gt;How to stay safe?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/phishing/3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Full-width image&quot; class=&quot;lead&quot; width=&quot;80&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always pay attention to the sender email and the URL of the links in the email. These provide you with enough indications of the authenticity of the email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/phishing/4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Full-width image&quot; class=&quot;lead&quot; width=&quot;80&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This webpage looks exactly the same as of the real Gmail sign in page. But as you can observe that the URL is the not the actual one. So look closely!! Hackers can easily replicate the websites so you should check the URL always.
One can also opt for extensions like the PhishDetector for Google Chrome in order to stay safe from all kinds of phishing.
Organizations can also opt for filtering methods for emails,links on the computers on their network:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Email Filtering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;URL-Filters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Script Filters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sender Based Filters
The filtering softwares are not very efficient and only cater to a certain previously known data set of emails/websites. The method of user training cannot guarantee prevention of phishing attacks. Overall, there is no fool-proof way to deal with phishing attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;present-scenario&quot;&gt;Present Scenario&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phishing attacks are now becoming pervasive and sophisticated. Phishing has spread beyond email to include VOIP, SMS, instant messaging, social networking sites, and even massively multiplayer games.Criminals have also shifted from sending mass-email messages, hoping to trick anyone, to more selective “spear-phishing” attacks that use relevant contextual information to trick specific victims.
The latest trend is phishing using Chatbots. According to a survey, users trust chatbots more than people online possibly as they think the bot is programmed.However, hackers have been found to change the code of the chatbot thus asking the user for sensitive info. Evidently, users give such details to chatbots and become phishing victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IoT(Internet of Things) devices are also becoming a victim of phishing due to their increasing popularity.IoT is a very fast evolving architecture these days connecting every day-to-day object making our lives more comfortable. Yes i am talking about all the SMART things in your house — Smart TV, Smart Refrigerator, Smart Plugs and whatever else you have. 😜But, due to limited resources available to the IoT devices, their security mechanism is close to absent which makes them a very easy target for the attackers. IoT devices are sent malware which spreads like botnets and the devices have to be taken offline and cleaned of malware.

I would rather call it E-conning so as to simply state what it really is.If something sounds too good to be true… there’s probably a scammer behind it.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/phishing/2.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/phishing/2.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
