People are getting scammed left and right. Data breach occurrences have skyrocketed over the past few years. Chances are, you may have already been hacked, atleast once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;your-digital-footprint&quot;&gt;Your Digital Footprint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;
All of our daily and regular tasks are online interactions. From sending important work communications to buying grocery and apparel, everything is available online. And with the virus impacting our lives immensely, we prefer online methods. Our entertainment is also online based, streaming services like Spotify, Youtube, OTT Platforms etc. Our social life has already been online for about a decade now. Rather, the question is what do we NOT do on the internet these days. Whatever you do leaves a &quot;digital&quot; footprint. Let me explain.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/hacked/hacked_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;drawing&quot; style=&quot;width:500px;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;
When you are shopping on an e-commerce website, something you buy is information for product companies, something you even put on your wishlist is also important data. This gives them an idea about what you use in your life and also what you even wish to have. And with the wide category of items online, over a period of time, they might know what you like better than even your own family (I am not joking). What posts you like on social media is data, what hashtags and people you follow is data about you. From the political leaders and influencers you follow and like, it implies the views they represent is what you agree with as well. Many of you might not know, wherever you go (if you don't have your settings right), your location/travel activity is logged in your phone. You go out for a family dinner, you post a picture on your social media timeline. Now, if you add a location while posting your picture, that also is information. This information helps one know about all your favourite restaurants. When you login into your Google account in your phone or browser, your search history is associated with your account and also stored. Suppose you search for a car repair shop near you, it implies your car requires repair. This information is valuable as well. The repair shop owners can use this info to find potential clients like you and offer you their services. In one perspective you are getting the services you are looking for but on the other hand your life is not private anymore. Online surveys are no different. Many corporate giants host surveys with rewards (even real money) for people to better get to know the market, its all about the information. It is all fine as long as it is anonymous, but when you get targeted marketing advertisements meaning whatever you do online gets associated with your online identity, people get to know more about you than you want them to know. In other words, privacy goes boom.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;digital-scams&quot;&gt;Digital Scams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;
A few years ago we used to recieve scam emails and SMSes giving us free rewards or lucky draw winnings. The scammers have upped their game now and now use popular platforms that we trust (I shall not name any platforms as its not their fault). Many of us have become aware about digital scams as they have been common as of late, especially with the popular use of e-wallets and UPI based transaction methods. Many reselling platforms and e-payment portals are used and the less tech savvy are fooled with ease. Often the person on the other end of the call sounds so sophisticated in their language and tone that even educated people and even those working for financial institutions get fooled easily. However, the scams are not just limited to payment related apps or portals, its also our messaging services we use very day. Someone getting a hold of our email or social media or messaging account is just as dangerous as identity theft is a major issue these days. According to NortonLifeLock, nearly 330 million people across 10 countries were victims of cybercrime and more than 55 million people were victims of identity theft in 2020.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have elaborated more on &lt;a href=&quot;https://aneeshdua.github.io/blog/tblog/2019-05-13-phishing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;phishing&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a digital scams) in another tech article, how its actually done and to why it still is the most efficient way of stealing money and gaining unauthorised access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-breaches&quot;&gt;Data Breaches&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;
When we register on a company's platform, the company stores the data associated with our account. This data can be just basic information like name and email-id but can also extend to confidential data such as Social Security number(Aadhar number), phone number, card details, home address etc. Now what if a malicious hacker gains access of this data? Of course many companies do their best to keep our data protected, data breaches still happen as nothing is ever completely secure. Also, many upcoming companies don't allocate budget to information security, with the perspective that who is going to hack them. This continues till the time someone actually does it. The data is usually not stored in readable form and is encrypted, but we have seen our credentials and personal information getting leaked and sold on the dark web, breached from small and big companies alike. It is evident that the data is attainable by malicious guys. So this is another leak point of your private data and many companies inform you of such incidents but on the other hand, many don't even acknowledge such incidents if brought to public (via independent researches) to avoid a PR crash. Often, hackers gain exclusive access to such data and hold it for ransom. Many companies don't pay the ransom, and take a PR hit. However, those that pay the ransom are attacked again,statistically speaking. It is obvious that the companies that paid the ransom once, are likely to pay again as compared to those who didn't the first time, ransom 101. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/hacked/hacked_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Full-width image&quot; class=&quot;lead&quot; width=&quot;80&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unknowingly-sharing-your-private-data&quot;&gt;Unknowingly sharing your private data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;

The bits and pieces of digital footprint you leave online are collated together and are used to identify you. Your activity is tracked. By activity I mean is where you go, what you search, what posts you like, what food you order, what apparel you wear etc. In other words, your life is continously logged in some server on the other side of the world. So how can they take this data without letting you know. Here is the catch, they often tell you before they do. We are just too lackadaisical or clueless about what is going on. Most of this data is tracked through the long software and cookie agreements you &quot;Accept/Allow&quot; while using the apps and websites. Also, many popular social media platforms have tracking settings enabled by default and the non-tech savvy user often misses them. Hence, more often than not, one is unwillingly but at the same time volunatarily sharing all private data for tracking. This data is shared with &quot;third-party services/companies&quot; that use this data for their marketing and eventually profit. This data even helps in the next election or the next agenda in the parliament. There is a documentary on Netflix called &quot;The Great Hack&quot; which elaborates about how the 2016 U.S presidential elections were won using the digital footprint of the citizens and targeted advertisements. Long story short, an analytics company had plethora of &quot;data points&quot; on each citizen of the country using which they could determine which states and citizens were in their favour and they could target the ones that weren't, using targeted sorts of social media means down to the invidividual voter's level. Thats a new level of electoral manipulation on a very large scale, to say the least. And to top that, a person requested the &quot;data points&quot; they had on him, however, the company never showed him the data which was technically his, period.

The other day I was looking for a particular electronics store contact number (for a smartphone related enquiry), so I did what everyone else does these days. I hit up a search on the most popular search engine - &quot;StoreName AreaName Contact Number&quot; (I have proxified the names obviously, but you get the idea). While I had just started a conversation on the call with the guy at the store I was looking for, I had already got missed calls from competitor stores nearby. I called back just to confirm my suspicions, and on an even more surprising note, he already knew that it was about a phone related enquiry and this was not even part of my latest web search. I think such incidents have happened to all of us more times than we can give this behaviour a benefit of the doubt or call it a coincidence. Its all just good business. I am sure 9 out of 10 people would not like this level of intrusiveness of their life. At this point, I don't even know who had their their prying eyes on my life and who sold the information to the competitor stores. Even the Internet Service Provider (ISP), the company that gives broadband services at home, also has access to what we browse on the internet, so they might be also be the spy. Who knows? 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-we-do&quot;&gt;What can we do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;&gt;
With the bunch of stuff that I discussed and probably scared you a bit now, let's talk about what we can do and what we should do. Its a tricky situation if I am being honest, as we are dependent on web services but also need our privacy. Here are a few things to get started:
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check if your any of your online accounts’s credentials have been in any data breach using your email id on &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;haveibeenpwned&lt;/a&gt;. If they have, make sure you have changed your password after the time of the data breach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change your password every 3-6 months as a good practice. All companies enforce this policy for their employees work accounts and with good reason. If you have a lot of accounts like me and have trouble remembering passwords, go for a PAID Password Manager. Don’t fall for the free ones, nothing is free. What seems free, is using your data most probably.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use incognito/private mode in your browser for web searching for products,courses, or anything that can be bought.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also use a VPN (go for a paid one) for anonymity of your web searches and also general network security. This also protects from your ISP knowing what all you visit on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do a web search to disable tracking for all your social media accounts and you will find guides for them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a less tech savvy person, all this will be a load of information to process and maybe scary. But times are changing and we need to adapt so we don’t get conned, by either petty scammers or big data giants. More importantly, we need to teach kids about staying safe online. Just like we tell them not to eat candy given by strangers, we also need to teach them to make sure they know what apps they install and use and  with whom they even talk to online. As the founder of Tor, Roger Dingledine, says, “If you care about privacy online, you need to actively protect it.”, so its about time we get a hold of our own online life and even start paying for security and privacy like we pay for our amenities. Paying for privacy and security should be the new normal.&lt;/p&gt;

Often, these two are stated as the first step for one to progress the spiritual journey of life. Also, it is advised to practice these habits for mental well being. But no one really talks about how does a person doing graduate studies or doing a 9-5 job, start from zero and then progress to eventually become decent at it (or maybe master it); the starting stage of anything is usually the most difficult part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-myth-around-meditation&quot;&gt;The myth around Meditation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a very common misconception about meditation that it is the act of sitting like a saint (for example- the lotus posture) and focusing on your breathing. Some religious people may also ask you to focus on the image or the thought of the avatar of God you worship. This is not all meditation is, but yes this is one way of practicing it. The core purpose of meditation is to learn to clear your head and enter the zone of peace and calm. You have to focus on attaining inner peace. Now what gives you peace, be it a God’s thought or something else, is for you to unravel yourself and find out. Its not about the lotus position or breathing in specific. These are just means of helping you achieve the meditative state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/mandm/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Full-width image&quot; class=&quot;lead&quot; width=&quot;80&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mindful-or-mindfull&quot;&gt;Mindful or Mindfull&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern world revolves around fast moving lives. We are jumping from one thing to the next. Multi tasking is the norm for quite a while now. The act of being mindful is quite the opposite. Suppose you are washing the dishes. Most probably you are washing the dishes just to get the chore done. You are probably thinking of what you are going to do next and if you are a super duper plan freak and know the next 5 tasks you are going to do, you will be probably be thinking about something else. Point is, you are not mind&lt;strong&gt;ful&lt;/strong&gt; while washing the dishes, but rather mind&lt;strong&gt;full&lt;/strong&gt;. Your mind is divided into washing and what you are thinking about. The sutra of mindfulness, if I simply put it- “Don’t think about anything else while doing something. Don’t do what you are doing just to get it over with. Be conscious of what you are doing at hand.” When you are mindful while doing anything, you actually think and talk to yourself only about that. You discover more about the relationship between yourself and what you are doing. Your sprinting and multiprocessing mind is brought to a rather serene state. Its like there is nothing better at the moment in the entire world apart from you and the dishes you are washing. The tranquil mind enjoying the time washing the dishes. Slowly, this chore becomes a “me” time for you to enjoy along with the company of dishes. And this realisation is a personal understanding between you and the dishes. This is something I find hard to explain by mere words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I would have said that outside of context, you will probably say “What?”(you might still say it even in context..lol)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/mandm/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Full-width image&quot; class=&quot;lead&quot; width=&quot;80&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that was pretty abstract. Infact you might ask, what is there in being mindful for a small task such as washing the dishes.  Well, the straight up answer is I really cannot say that you shall achieve such and such a definitive thing after embracing the “tiring” chore of splashing water over utensils. Maybe you discover a more efficient way of washing the dishes since that is the only thing on your mind right now. But the whole point is to create a sense of habit and also a sense of calm in your mind before it gets overwhelmed. The aim is to cultivate a habit of being focused on only what you are doing at the moment. How many times it has happened you made a mistake at work or study just because your mind was divided into 16 tasks(just a random number, feel free to pick yours). But if your mind is trained to be focused only on the current task at hand, the chances of making mistakes would be scarce. Another perspective to being mindful is that you are consciously breaking out of the rat race the modern living comes with. You are actually living and not in constant survival mode; easier said than done. You are conscious about yourself and the task at hand. The most important time is now and “live the moment” in truest sense of the phrase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-are-mms-so-delicious&quot;&gt;Why are M&amp;amp;Ms so delicious?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mind and heart are really chaotic. One feeling after another, one thought after another. The category of thought or feeling(good or bad; happy or sad; angelic or devilish)  is also not really definitive at a given point of time. Sooner or later we have our day(s) when we are just tired, just need a “break”. Yes I am talking about the can’t do this anymore kind of day(s). To avoid this sort of mental and will-power breakdown, it is important we take a break before our mind engine gets overheated. I feel that M&amp;amp;M are the key to the latter. Meditation and mindfulness are not very different. Infact, mindfulness is one way of meditating. I can give you a simple exercise incase you want one. Day one- Take a walk in the park, be only walking while you are at it. Explore the path and your legs while walking. Simply, walk the walk.(This is pure mindfulness)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you start doing it daily, you can change your focus on not the walk but self introspection. Maybe you want to talk to God. Maybe there is a thought on your subconscious mind. Something that is affecting your mood maybe. Or some question about your life or yourself you are not able to find the answer to. You are now only thinking about that. This is meditation. And with personal experience, I can say that this really works if you want to find yourself or if you wish to untangle the threads of your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A notable thing about M&amp;amp;M is that irrespective of your religious or regional belief, meditation is a common practice amongst all. Yoga(not the westernised exercise but spiritual original Indian one), which aims for utmost quality of physical and mental state includes meditation as one of the vital parts of a yoga abhyas(exercise). You will find equivalent practices in Buddhist and Zen beliefs as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incase you wish to learn more about mindfulness, I would recommend reading the works of Thich Nhat Hanh, who talks about it in much elaborative and detailed manner.I will leave you with a clipping of my favourite movie trilogy of all time- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lAKfUD169U&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kung Fu Panda&lt;/a&gt;. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

NC-Bug-Bounty was not solved by any participant, so here goes the solution writeup for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-landing-page&quot;&gt;The landing page&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landing page of the challenge is similiar to any bug bounty’s page. We are given an inscope domain and the story about the login portal being insecure is given to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/winja/landing-page.png&quot; alt=&quot;Full-width image&quot; class=&quot;lead&quot; width=&quot;80&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-interns-submission-round-1&quot;&gt;First Intern’s Submission (Round 1)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to the inscope domain, the first login portal is shown. After some basic enumeration you can understand that the credentials to login are neither in the web page’s source code nor in any text file on the web directory. SQL Injection should strike your mind at this time. If it didn’t, well, you will get it next time. And you are feel free to try out tools like SQLMap, which will probably fail, coz I tested them (Manual injection demon strikes :D)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets assume the SQL query in the backend to be something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sql highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Users&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&quot; + username + &quot;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&quot; + password + &quot;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic SQL Injection payload for such a query can be found out if not known by a simple google search:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sql highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;' or '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, the query that runs in the backend becomes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sql highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Users&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'admin'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'1'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&quot; + password + &quot;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, even though you do not know the real credentials, you were able to bypass the login.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;second-interns-submission-round-2&quot;&gt;Second Intern’s Submission (Round 2)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is pretty clear that the challenge is SQL Injection based, hence lets continue in that direction. Here, we are given a hint:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This intern’s work seems secret-ive. I guess he has his secrets on our database resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we understand that there is a secret table on the same database which we need to access. After some hit and trial or after the hint during the contest, you can make out that the table name is “secret_table”. Creating a union query so as to get the result from another table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sql highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;' union select secret from secret_table#
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it works! Even though you didn’t get to know the secret, you bypassed the second round. Isn’t that what matters? Right?…..Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/winja/secrets-meme.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Full-width image&quot; class=&quot;lead&quot; width=&quot;80&quot; height=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;third-interns-submission-round-3&quot;&gt;Third Intern’s Submission (Round 3)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hint for this round is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even this girl seems secretive. However, she said all the SQL commands will be blanked in the inputs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the takeaway from this is that there is still a secret_table in the database and that any SQL command you inject will be blanked- meaning it will be removed. So how do we get around this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if, you make this filter a double-whammy. You create such a query on which upon nullifying the SQL commands, you get the right one? For example -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sql highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;' uniunionon selselectect secret from secret_table#
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty clever,right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fourth-interns-submission-round-4&quot;&gt;Fourth Intern’s Submission (Round 4)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This intern’s information is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don’t know why are all these interns so secretive. This guy claims all the SQL commands will not be processed at all. He says he has considered both CASES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing on the still unknown secret, we now know that the SQL commands will not be processed. We can imply that if we include any SQL statements like SELECT or UNION, the input won’t be processed. However, there must be a catch(afterall, its a CTF). The hint also mentions about “both CASES”. Think, what has two cases?????&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you got it, incase you didn’t, its the &lt;strong&gt;UPPER&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;LOWER&lt;/strong&gt; case. So the intern didn’t consider the &lt;strong&gt;mIxEd&lt;/strong&gt; case. So the injection becomes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sql highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;' UNiON SElECT secret FrOm secret_table#
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking, how many interns did they hire?? I say you should have contacted Ramlal Kulkarni. (Only those who participated can get the joke,sorry for others)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fifth-interns-submission-round-5&quot;&gt;Fifth Intern’s Submission (Round 5)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s just get to the hint now, If I were you I would really wanna see the secret&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I guess I should hire non-secretive interns. Still lets give the last one a try. She doesn’t really like spaces tbh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the hint is clear and simple, there is still the secret table and this intern has found a way to block spaces? After all, who uses spaces in their username and password?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting thing about SQL comments is that “/**/” gets parsed as a space. Let’s use this to our advantage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sql highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/secret/**/FROM/**/secret_table#
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you get the flag finally,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;flag{nc-bug-bounty_t00k_y0u_l0ng_3n0ugh}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;end-notes&quot;&gt;End notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would be many different injections possible for the various rounds. Please, drop in the comments below what you came up with. Also, for people who are wondering if you could use the ASCII values to substitute SQL statements, you can do that in one of the rounds. In other rounds, I had blocked it so as to not make it the god query for the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interpreting the hints correctly and appropriate google search about SQL Injection Payloads would have helped one to solve the challenge all the way through.You can find the source code on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aneeshdua/Winja-CTF-Challenges&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.

Enough intro, lets talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-context-the-big-picture&quot;&gt;The context; the big picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a 100% pure and calm lake. Now a small contaminated water drop drops into this lake and causes ripples in the lake. The lake became disturbed for a while, before being calm again. But now it has some impurity in it. The essence isn’t the same anymore. Suddenly, someone feeds this lake more and more such drops, thereby causing a regular disturbance ripple and increased amount of contamination. Now in this, replace the lake with your relationship and the dirty water drop with misunderstandings or heated fights with personal attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, we have seen the increased number of nuclear families, short marriages, broken blood relationships and lack of good friendships. More often than not, especially in case of loved ones, it is miscommunication and improper handling of disagreements that leads to this unfortunate consequence. A small misunderstanding causes a heated debate which eventually leads to bitterness in the relationship, in most cases. You know what is the worst? When the personal attacks start popping out of angered emotions.This is the lowest point. Once you start attacking each other personally, I would say all objectivity is lost, and you are ultimately nowhere forward. Sounds familiar? Happens to almost all of us I believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-usually-happens-the-smaller-picture&quot;&gt;What usually happens; the smaller picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you and your close one are faced with a disagreement ,a conflict, or a circumstance created problem, the EGO enters the arena. Sad but true. You have one thing in mind and the other has the polar opposite of it. What happens next? You both start argueing on why you are right, ultimately losing the real perspective and the problem behind. It becomes a UN level debate wtih him/her even though both of you want (world) peace. Pun intended. You feel you are right.Interjection to your opinion sparks heated conversation. And trust me, the conversation isn’t lit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;faded&quot;&gt;(I know you must be thinking, does this guy have a point or just has a bunch of bad puns put together? I guess I really can’t help myself at times.**Chuckles on the puns**)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very common thing that I have noticed is that interrelationship problems originate from small and often, stupid misunderstandings. Small instances that occur or misinterpretation of what one said to the other is something all of us can relate to. Infact, a bad mood completely alters our viewpoint, makes us feel cynical about everything. Suddenly everyone around us is just straight up bad. These misunderstandings are the cause for negative bias towards the other if not handled delicately. Our mood affects how we interpret and react to something. End result? You are angry at your loved one, probably without good cause. Your consequent actions and words impacted by the latter most probably leads to a fight. Now both of you are in angered and rather confused emotional state. For most of us, the ego dominates. The arguement brews. You are now versus each other. Now take a breather. Wouldn’t it be better if it was both of you vs the problem? Facing the problem together? #Foodforthought&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-how-do-we-properly-handle-this&quot;&gt;So how do we properly handle this?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be saying that easier said than done. How do we actually practice this?&lt;br /&gt;
We are built in a way that it is almost natural for us to engage all defenses when we as an individual are told we aren’t right. Its the rejection reaction if I may say so. It is a very mature and probably difficult thing to do to actually acknowledge the opposite perspective and addressing it as viable or maybe correct a step further. Long story short, the meaning of “Us vs the Problem” rather than “You vs Me” is to realise that you are not facing this issue as an individual, but together. As one. In times of adversity,we forget such simple things hence this becomes easier said than done. You remove your individuality since this is not only yours to handle, use the trust that you and your loved one have built. Focus on the problem rather than proving yourself right and winning the arguement. Infact, it shouldn’t even be an arguement. Yes, clashes or differences of opinion don’t have to be arguements or debates. Normalise conflict resolution through DISCUSSION rather than debating the motion as to who is right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;end-notes&quot;&gt;End notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the beauty of this discussion approach if I may call it so, is that its all in your control. Life rarely gives that, if I am being really honest. Your perspective, your attitude, your way of talking, its all YOU.To build this perspective takes time and patience. It also requires the cooperation of your partner or loved one. Speaking in a more practical manner, for every kind of problem in relationships, you can do this. Your approach towards the conflict needs to be in a way you are addressing the problem, not fighting your solution on how to deal with it. You have to throw the dominating ego aside, DISCUSS the issue even though it may affect you more directly. Discussing instead of complaining or debating is the way I like to see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One question that you may have is that what if the other person doesn’t react similiarly? Well feel free to express this to them as a seperate discussion if you share such an understanding on things. After all, trying is life, isn’t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;faded&quot;&gt;(Or is life trying? I say depends on your day. #AnotherFoodforthought)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most joyous consequence of this is that your relationship comes out stronger than before. You overcome issues by teamwork, which strengthens the bond. So basically what you just did is you played an UNO Reverse card on the adverse situation. In trying times that test your relationship, you come out even better. I would even say that, winning an arguement is almost kiddish. And from personal experience, the satisfaction and joy of striding forward together makes you feel elated at a completely other level.  After all, I think, what is love, if not teamwork persevering?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Aneesh Dua</name><email>workstuff.dua@gmail.com</email></author><category term="lblog" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/usvsproblem/1.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/usvsproblem/1.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Hardening VS Countermeasures for Cyber Security</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/tblog/2019-06-23-hardening-counter/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hardening VS Countermeasures for Cyber Security" /><published>2019-06-23T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-06-23T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/tblog/hardening-counter</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/tblog/2019-06-23-hardening-counter/">&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;Cyber Attacks are exponentially increasing by the day. The omnipresence of Internet enabled devices around us makes such attacks terrorizing for us. Thus, to resist such threats, it is essential to develop mechanisms and protect our devices and networks. There are mainly two ways to go about it, either we build countermeasures against attacks or either we implement hardening of devices and connection methods. How should we go about it?
Lets discuss…….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hardening&quot;&gt;Hardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardening one of the most important components of system security. It is a method of securing devices/networks by minimizing the area exposed to the public. This makes sure that there are less vulnerabilities out in the open. This is done largely by removing unnecessary software, hardening default credentials, disabling unnecessary services, and modifying other configuration parameters from default values so that the system works securely for a focused set of services.
For networks and systems of the organisational and corporate level, the risk of security breach is high. Their systems are diverse and widely spread, hence, a hacker only needs to find one weak point in the plethora of connected devices to get into the network and he is really spoilt for choice! On the contrary, smaller networks such as home networks are relatively more secure as they have less areas of susceptibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter whichever new system is setup, the hardening process is critical to establish a baseline of system security, especially for an organization. Moreover, when a new system is bought, it comes pre-installed with a number of software, applications, services, drivers, features, and even bloatware. All these are points at which the security fence is weak and can be easily broken by hacker(s). It is, therefore, necessary to remove the unnecessary software and configure the necessary ones for additional security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actions that are normally taken when performing system hardening are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disabling certain ports and stopping certain services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removing certain features of the operating system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uninstalling unnecessary and vulnerable software&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changing default settings and removing features and applications not needed by your organization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensuring each system’s security configurations are set properly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensuring OS software, firmware, and applications are up to date&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensuring the system hardening process evolves constantly, with maximum automation and updating&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Testing during hardening of the systems to make sure anything critical to the organization is not impacted&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updating the hardening to include new patches or software versions in the standard configuration, so the addition of a similar system in future does not come with the old weaknesses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;countermeasures&quot;&gt;Countermeasures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developers of operating system and software do not think much about the security aspect. This is understandable because they are developers and not cyber security specialists. Hackers often exploit the developers’ code itself and compromise the integrity, availability and confidentiality of the systems. Hence, it is essential to have countermeasures so as to make software and operating systems secure.
In cyber security, methods that provide security against vulnerability threats and cyber attack(s) are known as cyber crime countermeasures. Antiviruses and Firewalls are the most common methods of providing cyber attack countermeasures. The companies that provide these, scan the internet for new malware and also perform vulnerability testing on the systems they are made to protect. This is done on a regular basis as they have to keep updating the operating systems for patching the bugs and release anti-malware methods.&lt;br /&gt;
There are mainly four basic types of countermeasures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preventative — These work by keeping something from happening in the first place. Examples of this include: security awareness training, firewall, anti-virus, security guard and IPS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reactive — Reactive countermeasures come into effect only after an event has already occurred.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Detective — Examples of detective counter measures include: system monitoring, IDS, anti-virus, motion detectors and IPS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Administrative — These controls are the process of developing and ensuring compliance with policy and procedures. These use policy methods to protect an asset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So….whats the conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I would think of it as an analogy to the Marvel Comics. Hardening is Captain America and Countermeasures are like Iron Man. Lemme explain.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/hdncntr/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Full-width image&quot; class=&quot;lead&quot; width=&quot;80&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Captain America was made into a more powerful soldier, hence, if I may, his abilities were hardened. His physique completely changed while his core remained the same, just like hardening of protocols and software architecture.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tony Stark made a super suit to defend the world from outer space threats. He did not make any changes to himself for this, the suit was an outer protective cover as a countermeasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these heroes in cyber security are essential and one can’t really compare. However, it maybe better to have hardened protocols rather countermeasures. Still countermeasures are always going to be exist because when it comes to cyber security, one can’t be 100% sure. It is important to note that the implementation of both affects the quality of their purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

Even today we encounter websites that are “down” a.k.a unavailable and the reason for that more often than not are DDoS attacks. Even though the principle of these have remained the same, we still don’t have a fool proof way of preventing them. Not beating about the bush, let me throw light as to what they actually are and why they are still a cyber security challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-it-is&quot;&gt;What it is?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A denial-of-service(DOS) attack is where hackers render a site inaccessible to legitimate customers. Hackers do this by overwhelming the website with traffic and data until the website crashes. Although denial-of-service attacks do not have a direct financial cost to the victims, the indirect cost of lost sales can be high not to mention the frustration of getting the website up and running again.
E-commerce websites are the most likely targets of denial-of-service attacks. That said, hackers have been known to go after different types of high-profile businesses including media agencies and government organizations.
Besides keeping your anti-virus software and security patches up-to-date, you should also be monitoring your traffic reports to protect against a denial-of-service attack. A sudden increase in traffic or other strange traffic patterns could be an early sign of this type of attack.
A distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is a special type of denial of service attack. The principle is the same, but the malicious traffic is generated from multiple sources — although orchestrated from one central point. The fact that the traffic sources are distributed — often throughout the world — makes a DDoS attack much harder to block than one originating from a single IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/ddos/2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Full-width image&quot; class=&quot;lead&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;motivation-behind-ddos-attacks&quot;&gt;Motivation behind DDoS attacks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trend of DDoS attacks is towards shorter attack duration, but bigger packet-per-second attack volume.
Attackers are primarily motivated by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rebellion— DDoS attacks as a means of targeting websites hackers disagree with ideologically.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business rivalry— Businesses can use DDoS attacks on their rivals to gain the customers of the other.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fun—Script-kiddies use pre-written scripts or softwre to launch DDoS attacks. The perpetrators of these attacks are typically bored.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cyber warfare — Countries these days have engaged in Cyber Warfare. Most of us are unaware of such events as they happen quietly on the Dark Web. Government authorized DDoS attacks are an example of the latter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;taxonomy&quot;&gt;Taxonomy:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Volume Based Attacks&lt;br /&gt;
Includes UDP floods, ICMP floods, and other spoofed-packet floods. The attack’s goal is to saturate the bandwidth of the attacked site, and magnitude is measured in bits per second (Bps).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Protocol Attacks&lt;br /&gt;
Includes SYN floods, fragmented packet attacks, Ping of Death, Smurf DDoS and more. This type of attack consumes actual server resources, or those of intermediate communication equipment, such as firewalls and load balancers, and is measured in packets per second (Pps).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application Layer Attacks&lt;br /&gt;
Includes low-and-slow attacks, GET/POST floods, attacks that target Apache, Windows or OpenBSD vulnerabilities and more. Comprised of seemingly legitimate and innocent requests, the goal of these attacks is to crash the web server, and the magnitude is measured in Requests per second (Rps).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-do-we-stand&quot;&gt;Where do we stand?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DDoS attacks are becoming increasingly commonplace, according to research published by Corero Network Security at the end of 2017. Its DDoS Trends and Analysis report found that the number of attacks increased by 35% between Q2 2017 and Q3 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason for their increased prevalence is the increasing number of insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices that are being infected and recruited into botnets such as Reaper.
The volume of data launched at DDoS attack victims has also gone up significantly, largely thanks to amplification attacks such as the memcached amplification attack technique. Earlier this year, cyber-criminals launched some 15,000 memcached attacks, including an attack on GitHub that maxed out at an astonishing 1.35 Tbps(Tera Bits per second).
There is no cure that fits all. There is no single fool proof method that can prevent or even stop a ddos attack due to the variety of the latter. So what do we do for such a disease?
We Vaccinate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-build-resistance&quot;&gt;How to Build Resistance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Buy more bandwidth(than you might ever need)
Of all the ways to prevent DDoS attacks, the most basic step you can take to make your infrastructure “DDoS resistant” is to ensure that you have enough bandwidth to handle spikes in traffic that may be caused by malicious activity.
In the past it was possible to avoid DDoS attacks by ensuring that you had more bandwidth at your disposal than any attacker was likely to have. But with the rise of amplification attacks, this is no longer practical. Instead, buying more bandwidth now raises the bar which attackers have to overcome before they can launch a successful DDoS attack, but by itself, purchasing more bandwidth is not a DDoS attack solution.
Even if you bought extra 100 percent — or 500 percent — that likely won’t stop a DDoS attack. But it may give you a few extra minutes to act before your resources are overwhelmed completely. So we go from seconds to disaster to minutes to stopping the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build redundancy into your infrastructure
To make it as hard as possible for an attacker to successfully launch a DDoS attack against your servers, make sure you spread them across multiple data centers with a good load balancing system to distribute traffic between them. If possible, these data centers should be in different countries, or at least in different regions of the same country.
For this strategy to be truly effective, it’s necessary to ensure that the data centers are connected to different networks and that there are no obvious network bottlenecks or single points of failure on these networks.
Distributing your severs geographically and topographically will make it hard for an attacker to successfully attack more than a portion of your servers, leaving other servers unaffected and capable of taking on at least some of the extra traffic that the affected servers would normally handle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Configure your network hardware against DDoS attacks
There are a number of simple hardware configuration changes you can take to help prevent a DDoS attack.
For example, configuring your firewall or router to drop incoming ICMP packets or block DNS responses from outside your network (by blocking UDP port 53) can help prevent certain DNS and ping-based volumetric attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deploy Anti-DDoS software modules
Your servers should be protected by network firewalls and more specialized web application firewalls, and you should probably use load balancers as well.Amazon Web Services provide load balancers to websites hosted on their server(EC2)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protect your DNS servers
Don’t forget that a malicious actor may be able to bring your web servers offline by DDoSing your DNS servers. For that reason it is important that your DNS servers have redundancy, and placing them in different data centers behind load balancers is also a good idea. A better solution may even be to move to a cloud-based DNS provider that can offer high bandwidth and multiple points-of-presence in data centers around the world. These services are specifically designed with DDoS prevention in mind.
However……
Preventing a DDoS attack when malicious actors can launch over 1 Tbps at your servers is almost impossible, and that means that it is more than important than ever to understand how to stop a DDoS attack after it has started to affect your operations. Here are some tips for when you are under such an attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identify the DDoS attack early
The detection phase requires analysis of the running system to discover malicious traffic that leads to a DDoS attack. Detection involves a sophisticated approach to identify large unexpected traffic against a web server. Most of the detection techniques were applied to form DDoS detection known as pattern matching, clustering, statistical methods, deviation analysis, associations, and correlation. Formation of detection usually employs data history as the main source to train the data to generate a threshold which will be assigned to a parameter via a specific method to count the GET request received.
If you run your own servers, then you need to be able to identify when you are under attack. That’s because the sooner you can establish that problems with your website are due to a DDoS attack, the sooner you can stop the DDoS attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Call your ISP or hosting provider
The next step is to call your ISP (or hosting provider if you do not host your own Web server), tell them you are under attack, and ask for help. Keep emergency contacts for your ISP or hosting provider readily available so you can do this quickly. Depending on the strength of the attack, the ISP or hoster may already have detected it — or they may themselves start to be overwhelmed by the attack.
You stand a better chance of withstanding a DDoS attack if your Web server is located in a hosting center than if you run it yourself. That’s because its data center will likely have far higher bandwidth links and higher capacity routers than your company has, and its staff will probably have more experience dealing with attacks. Having your Web server located with a hoster will also keep DDoS traffic aimed at your Web server off your corporate LAN so at least that part of your business — including email and possibly voice over IP (VoIP) services — should operate normally during an attack.
“It can be very costly for a hosting company to allow a DDoS onto their network because it consumes a lot of bandwidth and can affect other customers, so the first thing we might do is black hole you for a while,” said Liam Enticknap, a network operations engineer at PEER 1 hosting.
Tim Pat Dufficy, managing director of ISP and hosting company ServerSpace, agreed. “The first thing we do when we see a customer under attack is log onto our routers and stop the traffic getting onto our network,” he says. “That takes about two minutes to propagate globally using BGP (border gateway protocol) and then traffic falls off.”
If that was the end of the story, the DDoS attack would still be successful. To get the website back online, your ISP or hosting company may divert traffic to a “scrubber,” where the malicious packets can be removed before the legitimate ones are be sent on to your Web server.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a DDoS playbook
The best way to ensure that your organization reacts as quickly and effectively as possible to stop a DDoS attack is to create a playbook that documents in detail every step of a pre-planned response when an attack is detected.
This should include the actions detailed above, with contact names and telephone numbers of all those who may need to be brought into action as part of the playbook’s plan. DDoS mitigation companies can help with this by running a simulated DDoS attack, enabling you to develop and refine a rapid corporate procedure for reacting to a real attack.
An important part of your planned response to a DDoS attack that should not be overlooked is how you communicate the problem to customers. DDoS attacks can last as long as 24 hours, and good communication can ensure that the cost to your business is minimized while you remain under attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As of now there isn’t any silver bullet for DDoS attacks, the quest goes on!!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

I would rather call it E-conning so as to simply state what it really is.If something sounds too good to be true… there’s probably a scammer behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-it-is&quot;&gt;So what it is?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phishing in general means to copy a website or email and act as an authenticated person in order to trick the victim into revealing sensitive information. Such attacks can lead to damaging losses in terms of identity theft,sensitive intellectual property and customer information, and national-security secrets.
Phishers always take advantage of human nature that generally ignores critical warning messages. Lack of awareness about the phishing attacks in the society is also the main reason why phishing attacks have been so much successful. Whenever any researcher came with some technique to prevent these attacks, phishers try to ﬁnd out associated loophole to commit successful attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-damage-can-they-do&quot;&gt;What damage can they do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/phishing/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Full-width image&quot; class=&quot;lead&quot; width=&quot;80&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Theft of login credentials: Phisher steals login credentials of online services like eBay, Amazon and Gmail from the user using spoofed email as warning message to change password and provided hyperlink.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Theft of banking credentials: Online login credentials and credit card details such as card number, expiry and issue dates, cardholder’s name, CCV number and several other popular banking organizations like PayPal, OnlineSBI, HDFC and Citibank.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capture of personal information: Personal information, such as address and telephone number, is highly saleable and in constant demand by direct marketing companies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Theft of trade secrets and conﬁdential documents: With spear phishing techniques, phishers are targeting speciﬁc organizations for acquisition of proprietary information and used directly or sold to interested parties.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fame and notoriety: A very interesting psychological aspect of phishing in which information is phished not for ﬁnancial gain but carried out mainly to gain recognition and notoriety among their peers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exploit security holes: People who are curious to ﬁnd out how robust a particular system is may try to write programs to break somebody else’s system to launch phishing attacks or to sell the compromised systems to other phishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-a-bad-guy-actually-do-it&quot;&gt;How does a bad guy actually do it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stage-1-planning-and-setup&quot;&gt;Stage 1: Planning and setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ﬁrst step, the attackers identify the target organization or individual or a nation. Then, their task is to get details about the organization and its network. It can be done by visiting the place physically or monitor the trafﬁc going in and out of the network. The next step is to set up the attacks by using a feasible means, e.g., website or emails having malicious links, which may redirect the victim to some fraud web page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stage-2-phishingit-is-as-similar-to-fishing-as-it-sounds&quot;&gt;Stage 2: Phishing(it is as similar to fishing as it sounds)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to send these spoofed emails or links, e.g., masqueraded as some reputed banking organization to the victim using the collected email addresses, which ask user to update some information urgently by clicking on some malicious link. The emails might be sent to individuals or speciﬁc person in an organization. Basically, they send out such malicious links and wait for the fish to get caught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stage-3-break-ininﬁltration&quot;&gt;Stage 3: Break-in/inﬁltration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as the victim(fish) opens the fraud link, either a malware is installed on the system which allows the attacker to intrude the system and change its conﬁguration or access rights are changed accordingly. In other cases, it might lead to some fake page that asks for credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stage-4data-collection&quot;&gt;Stage 4:Data collection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the attackers get access to the user’s system, the required data are extracted, and if the user gives his account details to the attacker, they can now access his/her account, and this may lead to ﬁnancial losses to the victim. In case of malware attacks, now the attacker may get remote access to the system and get the data he/she wants whatsoever, or the compromised systems could be used for DDoS attacks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stage-5-break-outexﬁltration&quot;&gt;Stage 5: Break-out/exﬁltration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting the required information, the phisher now removes all the evidences, i.e., the false websites accounts. It is also observed that they track the degree of success of their attack for reﬁning future attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-stay-safe&quot;&gt;How to stay safe?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/phishing/3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Full-width image&quot; class=&quot;lead&quot; width=&quot;80&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always pay attention to the sender email and the URL of the links in the email. These provide you with enough indications of the authenticity of the email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/phishing/4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Full-width image&quot; class=&quot;lead&quot; width=&quot;80&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This webpage looks exactly the same as of the real Gmail sign in page. But as you can observe that the URL is the not the actual one. So look closely!! Hackers can easily replicate the websites so you should check the URL always.
One can also opt for extensions like the PhishDetector for Google Chrome in order to stay safe from all kinds of phishing.
Organizations can also opt for filtering methods for emails,links on the computers on their network:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Email Filtering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;URL-Filters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Script Filters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sender Based Filters
The filtering softwares are not very efficient and only cater to a certain previously known data set of emails/websites. The method of user training cannot guarantee prevention of phishing attacks. Overall, there is no fool-proof way to deal with phishing attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;present-scenario&quot;&gt;Present Scenario&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phishing attacks are now becoming pervasive and sophisticated. Phishing has spread beyond email to include VOIP, SMS, instant messaging, social networking sites, and even massively multiplayer games.Criminals have also shifted from sending mass-email messages, hoping to trick anyone, to more selective “spear-phishing” attacks that use relevant contextual information to trick specific victims.
The latest trend is phishing using Chatbots. According to a survey, users trust chatbots more than people online possibly as they think the bot is programmed.However, hackers have been found to change the code of the chatbot thus asking the user for sensitive info. Evidently, users give such details to chatbots and become phishing victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IoT(Internet of Things) devices are also becoming a victim of phishing due to their increasing popularity.IoT is a very fast evolving architecture these days connecting every day-to-day object making our lives more comfortable. Yes i am talking about all the SMART things in your house — Smart TV, Smart Refrigerator, Smart Plugs and whatever else you have. 😜But, due to limited resources available to the IoT devices, their security mechanism is close to absent which makes them a very easy target for the attackers. IoT devices are sent malware which spreads like botnets and the devices have to be taken offline and cleaned of malware.
So don’t be quick to click! Ciao!&lt;/p&gt;
