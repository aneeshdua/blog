Every motivational speaker or life guru talks about atleast one of the M&M- Meditation and Mindfulness. Often, these two are stated as the first step for one to progress the spiritual journey of life. Also, it is advised to practice these habits for mental well being. But no one really talks about how does a person doing graduate studies or doing a 9-5 job, start from zero and then progress to eventually become decent at it (or maybe master it); the starting stage of anything is usually the most difficult part.

## The myth around Meditation
There is a very common misconception about meditation that it is the act of sitting like a saint (for example- the lotus posture) and focusing on your breathing. Some religious people may also ask you to focus on the image or the thought of the avatar of God you worship. This is not all meditation is, but yes this is one way of practicing it. The core purpose of meditation is to learn to clear your head and enter the zone of peace and calm. You have to focus on attaining inner peace. Now what gives you peace, be it a God's thought or something else, is for you to unravel yourself and find out. Its not about the lotus position or breathing in specific. These are just means of helping you achieve the meditative state.

## Mindful or Mindfull
The modern world revolves around fast moving lives. We are jumping from one thing to the next. Multi tasking is the norm for quite a while now. The act of being mindful is quite the opposite. Suppose you are washing the dishes. Most probably you are washing the dishes just to get the chore done. You are probably thinking of what you are going to do next and if you are a super duper plan freak and know the next 5 tasks you are going to do, you will be probably be thinking about something else. Point is, you are not mind<strong>ful</strong> while washing the dishes, but rather mind<strong>full</strong>. Your mind is divided into washing and what you are thinking about. The sutra of mindfulness, if I simply put it- "Don't think about anything else while doing something. Don't do what you are doing just to get it over with. Be conscious of what you are doing at hand." When you are mindful while doing anything, you actually think and talk to yourself only about that. You discover more about the relationship between yourself and what you are doing. Your sprinting and multiprocessing mind is brought to a rather serene state. Its like there is nothing better at the moment in the entire world apart from you and the dishes you are washing. The tranquil mind enjoying the time washing the dishes. Slowly, this chore becomes a "me" time for you to enjoy along with the company of dishes. And this realisation is a personal understanding between you and the dishes. This is something I find hard to explain by mere words.

If I would have said that outside of context, you will probably say "What?"(you might still say it even in context..lol)

I understand that was pretty abstract. Infact you might ask, what is there in being mindful for a small task such as washing the dishes.  Well, the straight up answer is I really cannot say that you shall achieve such and such a definitive thing after embracing the "tiring" chore of splashing water over utensils. Maybe you discover a more efficient way of washing the dishes since that is the only thing on your mind right now. But the whole point is to create a sense of habit and also a sense of calm in your mind before it gets overwhelmed. The aim is to cultivate a habit of being focused on only what you are doing at the moment. How many times it has happened you made a mistake at work or study just because your mind was divided into 16 tasks(just a random number, feel free to pick yours). But if your mind is trained to be focused only on the current task at hand, the chances of making mistakes would be scarce. Another perspective to being mindful is that you are conciously breaking out of the rat race the modern living comes with. You are actually living and not in constant survival mode; easier said than done. You are conscious about yourself and the task at hand. The most important time is now and "live the moment" in truest sense of the phrase. 

## Why are M&Ms so delicious? 
Your mind and heart are really chaotic. One feeling after another, one thought after another. The category of thought or feeling(good or bad; happy or sad; angelic or devilish)  is also not really definitive at a given point of time. Sooner or later we have our day(s) when we are just tired, just need a "break". Yes I am talking about the can't do this anymore kind of day(s). To avoid this sort of mental and will-power breakdown, it is important we take a break before the our mind engine gets overheated. I feel that M&M are the key to the latter. Meditation and mindfulness are not very different. Infact, mindfulness is one way of meditating. I can give you a simple exercise incase you want one. Day one- Take a walk in the park, be only walking while you are at it. Explore the path and your legs while walking. Simply, walk the walk.(This is pure mindfulness)

Now you start doing it daily, you can change your focus on not the walk but self introspection. Maybe you want to talk to God. Maybe there is a thought on your subconscious mind. Something that is affecting your mood maybe. Or some question about your life or yourself you are not able to find the answer to. You are now only thinking about that. This is meditation. And with personal experience, I can say that this really works if you want to find yourself or if you wish to untangle the threads of your thoughts.

A notable thing about M&M is that irrespective of your religious or regional belief, meditation is a common practice amongst all. Yoga(not the westernised exercise but spiritual original Indian one), which aims for utmost quality of physical and mental state includes meditation as one of the vital parts of a yoga abhyas(exercise). You will find equivalent practices in Buddhist and Zen beliefs as well.

Incase you wish to learn more about mindfulness, I would recommend reading the works of Thich Nhat Hanh, who talks about it in much elaborative and detailed manner.I will leave you with a clipping of my favourite movie trilogy of all time- [Kung Fu Panda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lAKfUD169U){:target="_blank"}. Cheers!
